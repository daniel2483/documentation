You use the gemconnect script file to start, stop, restart, and view the status of Device
Manager V5.0.
The gemconnect script is installed in the %PLATFORM_HOME%/FRWK/bin directory. It
can be run from anywhere.


Run the script as follows:
gemconnect [-options] [-options with args] {start|stop|restart|state|help}

Note: Device Manager V5.0 may share the same platform with other LinqUs Over-The-Air Suite products; the script file starts and stops the entire platform.
