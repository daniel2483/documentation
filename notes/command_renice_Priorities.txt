NAME
     renice - alter priority of running processes

SYNOPSIS
     renice [-n increment] [-i idtype] ID...

     renice [-n increment] [-g | -p | -u]  ID...

     renice  priority  [-p]  pid...  [-g gid...]  [-p pid...]  [-
     u user...]

     renice  priority  -g gid...   [-g gid...]   [-p pid...]   [-
     u user...]

     renice  priority  -u user...  [-g gid...]   [-p pid...]   [-
     u user...]

DESCRIPTION
     The renice command alters the scheduling priority of one  or
     more  running  processes.  By  default,  the processes to be
     affected are specified by their process IDs.

     If the first operand is a number within the valid  range  of
     priorities  (-20  to 20), renice will treat it as a priority
     (as in all but the first synopsis form).  Otherwise,  renice
     will treat it as an ID (as in the first synopsis form).

  Altering Process Priority
     Users other than the privileged  user  may  only  alter  the
     priority  of  processes they own, and can only monotonically
     increase their "nice value" within the range 0 to  19.  This
     prevents  overriding  administrative  fiats.  The privileged
     user may alter the priority  of  any  process  and  set  the
     priority to any value in the range -20 to 19. Useful priori-
     ties are: 19 (the affected  processes  will  run  only  when
     nothing else in the system wants to); 0 (the "base" schedul-
     ing priority),; and any negative value (to  make  things  go
     very  fast).  20  is  an  acceptable nice value, but will be
     rounded down to 19.

OPTIONS
     renice supports the following option features:

       o  The first operand, priority, must precede  the  options
          and can have the appearance of a multi-digit option.

       o  The -g, -p, and  -u  options  can  each  take  multiple
          option-arguments.

       o  The pid option-argument can  be  used  without  its  -p
          option.

       o  The -i option can be used to specify the  ID  type  for
          the  ID  list.  This is preferred in specifying ID type
          over the use of the -g | -p | -u syntax, which  is  now
          obsolete. See NOTES.

     The following options are supported:

     -g              Interprets all  operands  or  just  the  gid
                     arguments  as  unsigned decimal integer pro-
                     cess group IDs.

     -i              This option, together with the ID list argu-
                     ments,  specifies  a  class  of processes to
                     which the renice command is  to  apply.  The
                     interpretation of the ID list depends on the
                     value of idtype. The valid idtype  arguments
                     are:  pid, pgid, uid, gid, sid, taskid, pro-
                     jid, and zoneid.

     -n increment    Specifies how the system scheduling priority
                     of  the specified process or processes is to
                     be adjusted. The  increment  option-argument
                     is  a  positive  or negative decimal integer
                     that will  be  used  to  modify  the  system
                     scheduling priority of the specified process
                     or  processes.  Positive  increment   values
                     cause  a  lower  system scheduling priority.
                     Negative  increment   values   may   require
                     appropriate  privileges  and  will  cause  a
                     higher system scheduling priority.

     -p              Interprets all  operands  or  just  the  pid
                     arguments  as  unsigned decimal integer pro-
                     cess IDs. The -p option is the default if no
                     options are specified.

     -u              Interprets all operands  or  just  the  user
                     argument  as  users. If a user exists with a
                     user name equal to  the  operand,  then  the
                     user ID of that user will be used in further
                     processing.  Otherwise,   if   the   operand
                     represents  an  unsigned decimal integer, it
                     will be used as the numeric user ID  of  the

                     user.

OPERANDS
     The following operands are supported:

     ID              A process ID,  process  group  ID,  or  user
                     name/user   ID,   depending  on  the  option
                     selected.

     priority        The value specified is taken as  the  actual
                     system  scheduling  priority, rather than as
                     an increment to the existing system schedul-
                     ing priority. Specifying a scheduling prior-
                     ity higher than that of the existing process
                     may require appropriate privileges.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Adjusting the scheduling priority of process IDs

     Adjust the system scheduling priority so  that  process  IDs
     987 and 32 would have a lower scheduling priority:

     example% renice -n 5 -p 987 32

     Example 2: Adjusting the scheduling priority of group IDs

     Adjust the system scheduling priority so that group IDs  324
     and  76 would have a higher scheduling priority, if the user
     has the appropriate privileges to do so:

     example% renice -n -4 -g 324 76

     Example 3: Adjusting the scheduling priority of  a  user  ID
     and user name

     Adjust the system scheduling priority so that  numeric  user
     ID 8 and user sas would have a lower scheduling priority:

     example% renice -n 4 -u 8 sas

NOTES
     The renice syntax

     renice [-n increment] [-i idtype] ID ...

     is preferred over the old syntax

     renice [-n increment] [-g | -p| -u] ID ...

     which is now obsolete.

     If you make the priority very  negative,  then  the  process
     cannot be interrupted.

     To regain control you must make the priority greater than 0.

     Users  other  than  the  privileged  user  cannot   increase
     scheduling  priorities  of their own processes, even if they
     were the ones that decreased the  priorities  in  the  first
