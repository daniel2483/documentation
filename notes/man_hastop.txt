DESCRIPTION
       The hastop command stops the VCS server and related processes on all systems, the local system, or a specific system.

       The value of the cluster attribute, EngineShutdown, specifies how the engine is to proceed when the hastop command is issued. Possible EngineShutdown
       attribute values and their significance are:

       ·  Enable - process all hastop commands (default behavior)

       ·  Disable - reject all hastop commands

       ·  DisableClusStop - do not process the hastop -all command, but process all other hastop commands

       ·  PromptClusStop - prompt for user confirmation before running the hastop -all command, but process all others

       ·  PromptLocal - prompt for user confirmation before processing the hastop -local command, but process all other hatstop commands

       ·  PromptAlways - prompt for user confirmation before executing any hastop command

       The EngineShutdown attribute value is not considered when the hastop command is issued with the -force option.

OPTIONS
       -local [-force | -evacuate -noautodisable]

       -local [-force | -evacuate -noautodisable]
              The -local option stops the VCS server on the system on which the command is issued. When the VCS server stops a system, the system’s service
              groups are also stopped. The -force option stops the VCS server, but allows the service groups to continue running. The -evacuate option migrates
              all groups to other systems, if possible. The -noautodisable option ensures that service groups that can run on the node for which hastop is
              invoked are not autodisabled while VCS is stopped. The -noautodisable option can also be used with -evacuate option, but not with -force option.

       -sys system ... [-force | -evacuate | -noautodisable]

       -sys system ... [-force | -evacuate -noautodisable]
              The -evacuate fails over the system’s active service groups to another system in the cluster, before the system is stopped. Otherwise, the
              applications are taken off line. The -sys option stops the VCS server on the system specified. Multiple servers may be specified. The -force option
              enables the service groups to continue running. The -noautodisable option ensures that service groups that can run on the node for which hastop is
              invoked are not autodisabled while VCS is stopped. The -noautodisable option can also be used with -evacuate option, but not with -force option.

       -all [-force]
              Stop the VCS server on all systems in the cluster, and take all service groups offline. The -force option specifies that the VCS server stops on
              all systems, but that service groups continue running.

       [-help]
              Display usage. Equivalent to using hastop without arguments.
