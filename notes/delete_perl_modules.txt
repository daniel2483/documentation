Uninstalling perl modules

As you know, going into the build directory for a module and executing 
"make uninstall" doesn't yet work for CPAN-installed modules :-)

For most modules, there is a .packlist file that lists all of the files 
that were installed by that module. Delete every file listed in the 
.packlist, then delete the .packlist file itself, and you've uninstalled 
the module.




Why would you want to do such a thing?  Just take the
path to this module out of @INC by editing your
.profile and or PERL5LIB variable, unless you think
its corrupt.

perl -le 'print join("\n", @INC);'

If you really want to remove this module do a backup
first, tar cvf module.tar /path/to/module, 
then rm -rf /path/to/module

Here is a script to see what is installed.

##-- Show me all installed Modules --##
use File::Find 'find';
use File::Spec::Functions;

my $i=0;
print "Your installed modules on $^O are:\n";
print "-" x 38,"\n";
find { wanted => sub { print ++$i, "\t$_\n" if
/\.pm\z/ },
    no_chdir => 1},
@INC;
 
Hope that helps! :)
