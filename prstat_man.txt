NAME
     prstat - report active process statistics

SYNOPSIS
     prstat [-acJLmRtTv] [-C psrsetlist] [-j projlist]
         [-k tasklist] [-n ntop[,nbottom]] [-p pidlist]
         [-P cpulist] [-s key | -S key ] [-u euidlist]
         [-U uidlist] [-z zoneidlist] [-Z] [interval [count]]

DESCRIPTION
     The prstat utility iteratively examines all active processes
     on  the  system and reports statistics based on the selected
     output mode and sort order. prstat provides options to exam-
     ine  only processes matching specified PIDs, UIDs, zone IDs,
     CPU IDs, and processor set IDs.

     The -j, -k, -C, -p, -P, -u, -U, and -z options accept  lists
     as  arguments.  Items  in  a list can be either separated by
     commas or enclosed in quotes  and  separated  by  commas  or
     spaces.

     If you  do  not  specify  an  option,  prstat  examines  all
     processes and reports statistics sorted by CPU usage.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -a

         Report information about processes and  users.  In  this
         mode  prstat  displays  separate reports about processes
         and users at the same time.

     -c

         Print new reports  below  previous  reports  instead  of
         overprinting them.

     -C psrsetlist

         Report only processes or lwps that are bound to  proces-
         sor  sets in the given list. Each processor set is iden-
         tified by an integer as  reported  by  psrset(1M).   The
         load averages displayed are the sum of the load averages
         of     the     specified     processor     sets     (see
         pset_getloadavg(3C)).  Processes  with  one or more LWPs
         bound to processor sets in the given list  are  reported

         even when the -L option is not used.

     -j projlist

         Report only processes or lwps whose project ID is in the
         given list. Each project ID can be specified as either a
         project name or a numerical project ID. See project(4).

     -J

         Report information about processes and projects. In this
         mode  prstat  displays  separate reports about processes
         and projects at the same time.

     -k tasklist

         Report only processes or lwps whose task ID is in  task-
         list.

     -L

         Report statistics for each light-weight  process  (LWP).
         By  default,  prstat reports only the number of LWPs for
         each process.

     -m

         Report microstate  process  accounting  information.  In
         addition to all fields listed in -v mode, this mode also
         includes the percentage of time the  process  has  spent
         processing  system  traps,  text  page faults, data page
         faults, waiting for  user  locks  and  waiting  for  CPU
         (latency time).

     -n ntop[,nbottom]

         Restrict number  of  output  lines.  The  ntop  argument
         determines  how  many lines of process or lwp statistics
         are reported, and the nbottom  argument  determines  how
         many  lines  of  user,  task, or projects statistics are
         reported if the -a, -t, -T, or -J options are specified.
         By default, prstat displays as many lines of output that
         fit in a window or terminal. When  you  specify  the  -c
         option  or  direct  the  output  to  a file, the default
         values for ntop and nbottom are 15 and 5.

     -p pidlist

         Report only processes whose process ID is in  the  given
         list.

     -P cpulist

         Report only processes or lwps which have  most  recently
         executed on a CPU in the given list. Each CPU is identi-
         fied by an integer as reported by psrinfo(1M).

     -R

         Put prstat in the real time scheduling class. When  this
         option  is  used,  prstat  is  given priority over time-
         sharing and interactive processes. This option is avail-
         able only for superuser.

     -s key

         Sort output lines (that is, processes, lwps,  or  users)
         by  key in descending order. Only one key can be used as
         an argument.

         There are five possible key values:

         cpu

             Sort by process CPU usage. This is the default.

         pri

             Sort by process priority.

         rss

             Sort by resident set size.

         size

             Sort by size of process image.

         time

             Sort by process execution time.

         key values are the same as for the -s option. See -s.

     -t

         Report total usage summary for each  user.  The  summary
         includes  the total number of processes or LWPs owned by
         the user, total size of process images,  total  resident
         set  size, total cpu time, and percentages of recent cpu
         time and system memory.

     -T

         Report information about processes and  tasks.  In  this
         mode  prstat  displays  separate reports about processes
         and tasks at the same time.

     -u euidlist

         Report only processes whose effective user ID is in  the
         given  list.  Each  user ID may be specified as either a
         login name or a numerical user ID.

     -U uidlist

         Report only processes whose real user ID is in the given
         list.  Each  user  ID may be specified as either a login
         name or a numerical user ID.

     -v

         Report  verbose  process  usage.  This   output   format
         includes the percentage of time the process has spent in
         user  mode,  in  system  mode,  and  sleeping.  It  also
         includes the number of voluntary and involuntary context
         switches,  system  calls  and  the  number  of   signals
         received.  Statistics  that  are not reported are marked
         with the - sign.

     -z zoneidlist

         Report only processes or LWPs whose zone ID  is  in  the
         given  list.  Each  zone ID can be specified as either a
         zone name or a numerical zone ID. See zones(5).

System Administration Commands                         prstat(1M)

     -Z

         Report information about processes and  zones.  In  this
         mode,  prstat  displays separate reports about processes
         and zones at the same time.

OUTPUT
     The following list defines the column headings and the mean-
     ings of a prstat report:

     PID

         The process ID of the process.

     USERNAME

         The real user (login) name or real user ID.

     SWAP

         The total virtual memory size of the process,  including
         all  mapped  files  and devices, in kilobytes (K), mega-
         bytes (M), or gigabytes (G).

     RSS

         The resident set size of the process (RSS), in kilobytes
         (K),  megabytes  (M), or gigabytes (G). The RSS value is
         an estimate provided by proc(4) that might underestimate
         the actual resident set size. Users who want to get more
         accurate usage information for capacity planning  should
         use the -x option to pmap(1) instead.

     STATE

         The state of the process:

         cpuN

             Process is running on CPU N.

         sleep

             Sleeping: process is waiting for an  event  to  com-
             plete.

             waiting.

         stop

             Process is stopped.

     PRI

         The priority of the process. Larger numbers mean  higher
         priority.

     NICE

         Nice value used in priority computation. Only  processes
         in certain scheduling classes have a nice value.

NOTES
     The snapshot of system usage displayed  by  prstat  is  true
     only  for  a split-second, and it may not be accurate by the
     time it is displayed.  When  the  -m  option  is  specified,
     prstat  tries to turn on microstate accounting for each pro-
     cess; the original state is restored when prstat exits.  See
     proc(4)  for  additional  information  about  the microstate
     accounting facility.

     The total memory size reported in the SWAP and  RSS  columns
     for  groups  of  processes  can  sometimes  overestimate the
     actual amount of memory used by processes with shared memory
     segments.
